Project Setup


AutoMapper
Packages used:
	- AutoMapper
	- AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
	
Use:
	- Used when we do not want to pass around domain entity around in our application. 
	- Create DTO that models from entity.
		Read from DB - Data from DB is fed to DTO & using automapper, DTO maps to Model which is passed to View
		Save to DB - Model passed from view is fed to DTO using autoMapper and DTO is used to save to DB
		
CQRS
Packages used:
	- MediatR
Use:
	Command Query Responsibility Segregation
		Query = Read from DB
		Command = Write to dB
		
	Per ideal implementation of pattern, we would have different data stores for read/write.
	For ex: Primary DB does the writes & read ops come from Read Replica etc.
	
	Promotes THIN CONTROLLERS. Business Logic moved to HANDLERS
